# Elevator problem

This is my object oriented solution, the solution is partial. Single elevator functions somewhat correctly. However I'm pretty sure it looses some events occasionally.

See the integration tests at [`src/__tests__/integrationtests.ts`](./src/__tests__/integrationtests.ts) and the main source code at [`src/elevator.ts`](./src/elevator.ts).
